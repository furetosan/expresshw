I just want to make the world silky smooth!

And soon, I will!! Muahahahaha!!!

Anyway... on to the serious stuff: this is supposed to be a silly proof of concept put together by glueing (gluing?) leveldb and nodejs as a simple framework.

On top of it, I intend to build simple multiplayer games, and then take it from there.

Also, come by and chat:
